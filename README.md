Reademe for Raytracer
=====================

I tried to follow the book's example raytracer implementation as closely as
possible, creating structures and enumerations to essentially allow the books
pseudocode to directly compile in C.

My raytracer is pretty complete, but still has some minor errors with hollow
sphere handling and reflections in certain circumstances.  Overall, I think
my grading breakdown should resemble the following:

5/5 Input Parsing
5/5 Coding Style
10/10 Ray Casting and Ambient Sphere Display
8/10 Local Illumination (Some problems with hollow spheres)
7/10 Reflections and Shadows (Some problems with nested reflections)
